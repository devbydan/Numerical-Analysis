# Numerical Analysis - MATH135A

This course studies basic numerical techniques for computing solution of problems in science and engineering. The topic includes floating point computation, error analysis, numerical methods for solutions to linear and nonlinear equations, numerical interpolation.

## Textbook

Numerical Methods Using Matlab, Third Edition, by J.H. Mathews and K.D. Fink

### Homework

Homework will be assigned each Wednesday and will be due in the discussion on the following Thursday. You must show all appropriate work in order to receive full credit for an answer. Show your work that is clear enough to be understood by the Teaching Assistant.

### Programming Project

Projects that involve implementation/programming/computation will be assigned after each chapter. Matlab or other programming language can be used for the projects.

## Academic Integrity

You are welcomed to discuss the material with each other in a general way, however you may not consult anyone else's written work, drafts, etc. All work that you submit must be your own.

Marked similarity in form or notation between submissions with different authors can be regarded as evidence of academic dishonesty. You must cite any reference you use and clearly mark any quotation or close paraphrase that you include. Such citation will not lower your grade, although extensive quotation might.
